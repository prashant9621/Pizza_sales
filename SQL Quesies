```sql
SELECT SUM(total_price) AS Total_Revenue FROM pizza_sales;

Average Order Value: Determine the average order value.
SELECT (SUM(total_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)) AS Avg_order_Value FROM pizza_sales;

 Total Pizzas Sold: Calculate the total number of pizzas sold.
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS Total_pizza_sold FROM pizza_sales;
 Total Orders: Count the total number of orders placed.
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders FROM pizza_sales;
Average Pizzas Per Order: Find the average number of pizzas sold per order.
SELECT CAST(CAST(SUM(quantity) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) / CAST(COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS Avg_Pizzas_per_order
FROM pizza_sales;


B. Daily Trend for Total Orders
SELECT DATENAME(DW, order_date) AS order_day, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS total_orders 
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(DW, order_date);
C. Monthly Trend for Orders
SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, order_date) AS Month_Name, COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS Total_Orders
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY DATENAME(MONTH, order_date);
D. % of Sales by Pizza Category
SELECT pizza_category, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_category;
E. % of Sales by Pizza Size
SELECT pizza_size, CAST(SUM(total_price) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS total_revenue,
CAST(SUM(total_price) * 100 / (SELECT SUM(total_price) FROM pizza_sales) AS DECIMAL(10,2)) AS PCT
FROM pizza_sales
GROUP BY pizza_size
ORDER BY pizza_size;
F. Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category
SELECT pizza_category, SUM(quantity) AS Total_Quantity_Sold
FROM pizza_sales
WHERE MONTH(order_date) = 2
